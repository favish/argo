# DEPRECATED: - todos now managed via JIRA

# Things TODO

- External helm chart for argo.yml

- version command
- argo status, show whats installed

- Add a -y flag to auto-yes everything

- helm init needs to start, potentially verify helm installation but should be taken care of by `argo components start` now

- Adjust the congratulations text for remote environments

- Warn if no blackfire environment vars are set

- argo should be able to abstract away minikube service list

- argument or separate command for updating kubectl environment to point to a particular project

- create argo method for updating projects

- where are the mysql credentials

- figure out directory structure for /var/www/html with the addition of web from drupal composer project

- create a mysql sql-dump wrapper for argo

- argo project recreate (constantly deploying weird)

- it should be easier to exec into php

- notify user when update is available

- Move example to deployments, add composer setup for it
